    "DescriptionText" : "The LUMI-POD 100 is a dedicated Remote Head for large heavy Stage lights up to 65 kg that need to be panned and tilted in real time to follow live action.\n\nThe LUMI-POD 100 uses the heavy-duty gearboxes of the POWERPOD 600 that can carry up to 100 kg with ease.\n\nIts tubular chassis with adjusting clamps make changing for different lamp size and balance simple.\n\nThe introduction of Volume Screen Technology highlighted the need to be able to Pan and Tilt large lights that can follow on set movement. These lights were not designed with remote heads in mind but usually to be mounted on a yoke assembly that would be mounted on a lighting stand or static lighting truss. Unlike fitting a camera to a remote head, large lights are often best mounted by clamping to both the top and the bottom of the lamp chassis. This is made easy by the many clamping options that the LUMI-POD 100 offers. Its easily adjusted for size chassis, gives a safe and reliable system that is both practical and versatile.\n\nThe LUMI-POD 100 travels on its own transport dolly with the lamp already fitted if needed.",

    "DescriptionText" : "Laptop dolliy incl. pneumatic wheels, steering rod, track wheels, push bar, tripod tie downs, 3x 100mm bowls, Euro adaptera and Inlay (PSLTD1)\nDesigned specifically by PROSUP for the Video / Film maker, who requires mobility with capacity and strength, the laptop dolly succeeds with this requirement.\n\nProsup designed the LapTop Dolly specifically for small Broadcast / Video teams. The dolly is made of CNC engineered aluminium and stainless steel. Camerman can mount the E-Jib onto the Dolly.\n\nThe original dolly size is 90x70cm (35.5x27.5\") and thus it clears any door opening.  The ingenious folding mechanism allows the dolly to minimize in size and to fit a Pelicase.\n\nThe dolly comes with 3 pre-mounted 100mm bowls for low shots. Straight travel shots are secured by a track locking mechanism.\n\nThe LapTop Dolly can take a camera person with the swivel support or a tripod with the tripod tie downs or a pedatsal column via specially made adapters.\n\nThe turnstile can be mounted to facilitate a swivel of 360° around the centre post. Besides the standard centre position, the swivel support unit can also be mounted offset thus allowing the camera person for additional moving space.The riser sits on the Euro mount of the swivel and comes with a 100mm bowl on the top. Via the 100 to 150mm adapter, bigger fluid heads can also be mounted.\n\nThe riser and the seat can be extended and locked to the most convenient position. Pedestal Columns Removable columns of the most popular pedestals can also be fitted on the LapTop Dolly. The necessary adapters and receptacles are available in the Prosup accessory range. Thus the dolly is a great solution for any OB work with diffcult floor conditions. The packing concept of the LapTop Dolly is really unique.\n\nOn three levels all necessary accessories can be stored away:\n\n- Bottom: air tyre set and tie downs for rock-solid lock of a tripod to the dolly\n\n- Middle: track wheel set for straight and curved tracks, push bar to be mounted on either side of the dolly, steering lock for track mode and straight ahead travel, space for Euro mount and air pump.\n\n- Top: the folded LapTop Dolly platform\n\nFully loaded and including the case the unit comes to over 40kg (90lbs) while the dolly itself weighs in with a mere 15kg (33lbs)",

As a result of having a larger surface area and by having three feet, it makes leveling a whole lot easier! We just couldn't call it anything else - Elephant Blocks!\n\nManufactured of the highest quality 9-ply 'Baltic Birch' plywood, Elephant Blocks replace conventional Basso Blocks. The improved design allows them to stack in limitless configurations in 1\" increments while accomplishing the same elevating function and support as Bassos. And they occupy less space!

    "DescriptionText" : "STANLEY FATMAX® XTREME™ box beam levels have been designed to provide durability and accuracy, providing you with the performance you need for every job. The patented continuous edge enables the ability to draw or scribe uninterrupted lines along the full length of the level. The fine milled primary edge provides 0.5mm/m accuracy, with a secondary edge accuracy of 0.8mm/m. The fully secured vial technology is designed to protect the vials against drop damage, while the 90% larger plumb vial provides an easier-to-see bubble for better visibility. The shock absorbing end caps are rubber moulded to protect the level from drop damage and feature raised anti-slip surface protectors to help protect against slipping and surface marking. Additionally, the end caps can be removed, making 90-degree markings and corner lines easier and more accurate. Strategically placed finger grab rails and wrap around handed grips are also incorporated for easier one handed use and better ergonomic design. Magnetic versions of the levels are available for specialised applications such as drywall construction and are equipped with stronger rare earth magnets than previous models.",

It has been designed considering the compatibility with the Scorpio equipment and the comfort of the technician, the operator and the driver.\n\nThe Vehicle\nBased on a CARON vehicle, it has been modified to be 100% electric keeping the original gearbox to offer a wide range of low gears to reach unthinkable positions for telescopic cranes. The cabin of the e-Scorpion is articulated up to 20º respect the main body, facilitating the driving through rough terrain. Power steering, LED driving lights, 4WD and a status panel with all the information of the vehicle (batteries level, current consumption…) also eases the driving experience. For the rainy days, the connections of the car are IP67 certified, and the whole vehicle can be sunken in water bodies up to the wheel axes. Equipped with two winches (one in the front part, one in the rear part of the vehicle), there is no way to get stuck, and with a build-in hitch ball, it can tow all the accessories needed for the production. Although the e-Scorpion is not homologated to drive through open traffic, the design allows it to be transport inside a truck, even with the crane mounted on it.\n\nThe base platform:\nThe e-Scorpion base design allows to operate the arm from the ground allowing the arm to spin 270º at the maximum inclination of the telescopic arm. The base also has specific compartments for the arm weights or other accessories required for the arm operation. It has support points for the arm respect the column and locking points from the arm to the vehicle for safely transporting the arm to the required position.\n\nHydraulic system:\nOnce the e-Scorpion is on position, four telescopic levelling jacks operated by an independent hydraulic system can be used to stabilize the base to the ground. Four different hydraulic pistons level the telescopic column up to 12º respect the base. All the hydraulic system to stabilize and level the base is build in a modular compartment completely independent from the motion of the vehicle and the valves for the pistons can be either manually or automatically used with an external console. One hydraulic piston extends the three section column up to 766cm from the base platform even with the arm fully loaded up to 2000kg.",

    "DescriptionText" : "The RatHat is a lightweight, Mitchell mount, modular low hat system machined from high grade billet aluminium and delivered hard black anodised. It can alternatively be configured with a bowl interface too.\n\nWeighing 1.4Kg (just over 3lbs) it is 70% lighter than the competition\n\nThe bases truncated triangular design makes it far easier to use wedges for levelling. Threaded holes on each corner allow the addition of optional levelling feet. This means you no longer have to rely on wedges that are easily knocked out of place in error! Quick and easy to install and remove in the field, the levelling feet allow you to adapt to your shooting environment efficiently.\nThe Rat Hat ships as standard in a low hat configuration. It’s modular design means it can be easily transformed into a high-hat configuration by simply adding 3x 100mm risers. You have the option of ordering these high-hat risers in addition to the standard risers, or have the Rat Hat configured as a high-hat only.\nCustom anodising colours & engraving available upon request – please detail it in your order notes at checkout.",

    "DescriptionText" : "These days, the challenge is to do more with less -- for less. That is why we came up with the Dana Dolly.\n\nDesigned for the times where you just want to do a little 6' to 8' dolly move without a lot of setup. The Dana Dolly is easy to set up, can be used with a variety of track options, and can be supported using standard junior stands, apple boxes, or the ground, whatever the shot requires.\n\nWhether you're an established professional or just getting started, the Dana Dolly is a great solution for adding production value to your shoot. Designed to be flexible, affordable, and easy to set up. Designed by a key grip with over 20 years of experience in all types of production, the design is simple and practical. The Mitchell Mount can take all types of camera heads with available adapters.\n\nThe sixteen-wheel design with floating trucks provides a smooth glide. The track ends and center support can use any 1 1/4\" pipe as a track: aluminum, stainless steel, etc. So, if you're on location and don't want to pack track, you can stop by a home center and pick up some pipe or conduit as an alternative to the Schedule 80 aluminum pipe we recommend for everyday use.",

With clever engineering, we have managed to make the new MB24X 200kg lighter in fully loaded form than our standard MB24. The 3-point guide rail section support, giving it unique stiffness. The MB24X is equipped with a new foldable base, allowing it to go through narrow openings, and with its low turning radius to be positioned in tight spaces. The bases’ articulated arms allow them to be used on standard dolly tracks of 100cm and 62cm in width. The new MB24 X with its light weight, high load and reach capabilities and highly maneuverable base, makes it ideal for the broadcasting and film markets.",

The Focus dolly is a complete lightweight, ultra-portable dolly. It fits together in less than three minutes, and the design incorporates dual features. When closed down, the dolly becomes a portable flightcase, the push/pull handle functioning as the transport handle. The dolly track wheels or hard rubber wheels simply pop in the sockets of the dolly. The trackwheels, which operate on both curved and straight track, are stored inside the dolly case for transportation. The Focus Seat Support completes the focus dolly as a multi purpose package.",
